    "tackle with TKET:\n",
    " 1. \"[Estimating phases with Hadamard Test and Cat States](https://github.com/CQCL/ethz-hackathon22/blob/main/hadamard_test.md)\". This problem explores some of the more theoretical questions around building applications of quantum computing for quantum chemistry and Hamiltonian simulation. A bit more maths and physics heavy.\n",
    " 2. \"[World-class routing](https://github.com/CQCL/ethz-hackathon22/blob/main/routing.md)\". Dive into the state-of-the-art of quantum circuit compilation. This problem is more applied, open-ended and programming-heavy: you'll have to come up with your own implementations and benchmark your results.\n",
