    "\n",
    "You can get access to [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/) and [IonQ](https://ionq.com/) simulators, emulators, and quantum machines through Microsoft Azure. When creating your workspace, first-time users automatically get free 500 (USD) Azure Quantum Credits for use with each participating quantum hardware provider. If you have consumed all the credits and need more, you can apply to the [Azure Quantum Credits program](https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3fl9dfFrkC3g0aG?aq_source=organic). For this Hackathon, we will use the simulators and emulators that do not use Azure Quantum Credits and hence are entirely free.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you don’t have an Azure subscription, you can [create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). If you are a student and have a university email, check out the free Azure accounts [for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). With Azure, you can create, deploy, and manage applications across multiple clouds, on-premises, and at the edge. You will get 200 (USD) Azure credit to use in other Azure services. For information regarding the application process to the Azure Quantum Credits Program see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/azure-quantum-credits?tabs=tabid-portal). Read over the details carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that Azure credits are not the same as Azure Quantum Credits. When you create a new Azure account, you get 200 (USD) of free Azure Credits to use in your first 30 days on Microsoft services. You can only use general-purpose Azure Credits with the Microsoft providers. 3rd-party providers (providers that Microsoft doesn't own) aren't eligible. Azure Quantum Credits can be used to run programs on quantum hardware. First-time users automatically get free 500 (USD) Azure Quantum Credits on top of the 200 (USD) free Azure Credits for use with each participating quantum hardware provider. Once you have consumed all the credits, you will get error messages when submitting new jobs, and you can then upgrade to a new plan to keep using the selected quantum hardware providers.\n",

    "You must provide a credit or debit card during the application process. Microsoft Azure will make a temporary authorization on this card, but you won’t be charged unless you move to pay-as-you-go pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, there are no costs or charges to using your free credits, there may be some small storage costs, as the input and output of your credits jobs are stored in a storage account that you pay for. Job data is typically <1MB per job. For more details, see [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/). "
